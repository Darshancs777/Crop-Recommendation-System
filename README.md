## Introduction

Agriculture plays a crucial role in the global economy and food security. However, selecting the right crop to plant can be challenging due to varying environmental conditions, soil properties, and other factors. The Crop Recommendation System aims to simplify this decision-making process by analyzing multiple factors to recommend the best crop for a given piece of land.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use web interface for inputting soil and environmental data.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze data and provide recommendations.
- **Data Visualization**: Graphical representation of data and recommendations for better understanding.
- **Extensible Framework**: Easily adaptable to include new data sources and recommendation criteria.

## Installation

To install and run the Crop Recommendation System, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Darshancs777/crop-recommendation-system.git
    cd crop-recommendation-system
    ```

2. **Create and Activate Virtual Environment**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the Application**:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can use it as follows:

1. **Input Data**: Provide necessary soil and environmental parameters such as pH, rainfall, temperature, humidity, and soil type.
2. **Get Recommendations**: The system will analyze the input data and recommend the most suitable crops to plant.
3. **View Results**: Results are displayed with detailed explanations and visualizations.

## Data

The system uses a variety of data sources to make accurate recommendations, including:

- **Soil Properties**: pH level,nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
- **Climate Data**: Temperature, rainfall, humidity.


## Model

The machine learning model used in this system is built using the following steps:

1. **Input data**: user can input data based on soil and enviroment condition.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess data for analysis.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Extract relevant features for the model.
4. **Model Training**: Train the model using various algorithms such as Random Forest, Decision Trees, or Neural Networks.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
6. **Deployment**: Deploy the trained model for real-time recommendations.
